# Real Estates - Price Prediction

## Project Overview
Dragon Real Estates is a data mining project focused on predicting real estate prices using various machine learning algorithms. The aim is to provide accurate predictions of property prices based on a dataset containing property features like location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains real estate listings with features such as:
- Location (City, Neighborhood, Zip Code)
- Property Type (Apartment, House, Commercial, etc.)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Area (in square feet)
- Year Built
- Amenities (Parking, Pool, Garden, etc.)
- Sale Price (Target Variable)

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately estimates real estate prices. The objectives include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and correlations.
- Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, Encoding categorical variables, Scaling numerical features).
- Model Training using various algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Model Evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning to improve model performance.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dragon-Real-Estates.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
 jupyter notebook Dragon Real Estates.ipynb
```

## Results
- Achieved an RMSE of [Your RMSE] and R² Score of [Your R² Score].
- Comparison of models showed that [Best Model] performed the best.

## Future Work
- Implementing advanced models like Neural Networks.
- Incorporating external data (e.g., economic indicators, proximity to amenities).
- Deploying the model as a web application.
